The To-Do List Application is a menu-based program that lets users manage tasks easily through the terminal. When you run the program, it shows a menu with four options:

1.Add a Task – The user types in a task, and it is added to the list.

2.View Tasks – Displays all the tasks added so far.

3.Delete a Task – Shows the task list with numbers. The user enters the number of the task they want to delete, and it is removed.

4.Exit – Ends the program.

The program also includes error handling. It shows a message if the user enters invalid input (like letters instead of numbers) or tries to delete a task when none exist. It keeps running until the user chooses to exit.

This project uses basic Python features like:

~Lists

~Loops (while)

~Conditional statements (if-elif-else)

~Try-except blocks for error handling

~input() and print() functions

It's a great starting point for learning how to build real-life command-line tools using Python.
